I ditched my smartphone 6 days ago and I've already finished two (physical) books since then. A day without a smartphone requires careful planning and much more verbal communication &ndash; and I like that a lot. I actually know what's going on around me, even when I commute. My thoughts are more organized.

My new phone lasts some 6 days with a single charge. I send SMS messages. Savage.

I check my email twice a day: when I arrive to work and right before I leave. I casually read the news. I wear my wristwatches again and I love it. I use an actual camera again, and I love that, too.

I enjoy having single-purpose objects with me again &ndash; even if I have to carry a slightly bigger bag.
