Text: 

and let 2020 take over. This year seems particularly shitty so far in most terms. I thought last year was the worst of all &ndash; yet this one proves me wrong month by month.

*Of course I know numbers don't make any difference, but each new year seems to be a fresh start, therefore gives the feeling of "reset" for most.*
