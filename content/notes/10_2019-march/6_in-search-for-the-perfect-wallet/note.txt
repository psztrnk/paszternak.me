Title: In search for the perfect wallet

For some time now, I'm in a hunt to find the perfect wallet that suits my needs. I know *exactly* what I carry around, so I pretty much explored all the pros and cons of different wallet types.

### The options

*The big and bulky.* I keep my wallet in my jeans' front pocket, so that's not an option. Besides, I don't carry around much stuff, so it'd be an overkill.

*The ultra-light, minimalist card holder.* I need to carry around some cash as well. I use to buy stuff in stores (a bakery, actually, my favorite one) where card payment is not an option (yep, in 2019). The problem with the minimal approach is that it works perfectly in a cashless world, yet keeps crippling your notes. I now carry a Jaimie Jacobs "(link: https://www.jaimiejacobswallets.com/products/nano-boy text: Nano Boy target: _blank)" &ndash; I really like it, but can you notice the creasy banknotes?

*Technically*, you can keep cash in it, sure (see product photos). But it's always a pain in the butt to get a single note out. It's impossible, in fact, you need to pull out all of them, fold them out, take one, fold back the rest, stuck them back again. Previously, I was carrying a Columbia leather wallet with a money clip on the back ((link: https://www.amazon.com/Columbia-Leather-Wallets-Men-Minimalist/dp/B004ARW8PY text: this one target: _blank)) &ndash; which was also cool, but leather pockets sadly keep broadening with use, and sooner or later they won't hold the cards properly. Also, the clip leaves the notes exposed, so it doesn't prevent damage. 

And there's the mysterious "*third type*", which suits my needs.

### So, what are my needs exactly?

I don't really have big or exceptional needs, actually: I need to carry around
- four or five cards,
- one of which (the debit card) needs to be drawn as fast and conveniently as possible, and
- some cash, preferably unharmed and accessible.

And that's basically it. 

### The "third type"

The mysterious "third type" keeps a slim profile to fit in the front pocket, covers the notes entirely without having to fold them at least two times, enables access for the individual notes and have a slot for the card most used. All of these combined &ndash; boom!, you have the perfect wallet, Adam.

And I've finally managed to narrow down the possibilities to three candidates.

I really like the simple approach of this wallet, however it
1. sadly doesn't meet the "quick-draw requirement" and
2. I somehow feel inappropriate to pay $57 (plus shipping) for something that is basically a piece of leather and a hair strap.

Sorry.

**2. (link: https://www.focx-wallet.com/produkt/purist-black-leather-wallet/ text: Purist Black by FOCX target: _blank)**

This is a really, like, really-really nice one. I'd be extremely happy with the overall look and feel of the Purist &ndash; but sadly this one also bleeds out on my need to be able to access one card quickly. You see, *it has* a pull tab to quickly draw a card &ndash; but it is on the *inside* of the wallet. You need to open the thing every single time to access the tab, so what the hell is the point of having one?

**3. (link: https://www.trove.cc/collections/trove-cash-wrap text: Trove Cash Wrap by Trove target: _blank)**

Now, I feel this might be the one. Swallows all my cards &ndash; check. Protects all my banknotes &ndash; check. Has an outer pull tab for the one card I use the most &ndash; check.

Plus, it comes in a wide variety of colors and also materials, so everyone can find the one that suits them. I went on with the "(link: https://www.trove.cc/products/trove-cash-wrap-reflex-black text: Reflex Black target: _blank)".

Is this the end of my hunt for the perfect wallet? I don't know &ndash; yet. I guess I'll find out in a couple of days, once it arrives.
